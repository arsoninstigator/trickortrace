# OnBoard

> Interested in joining? Head over to [`DIRECTIONS.md`](./DIRECTIONS.md) to get started!

Our goal is to get high schoolers excited about electronics and circuit board (PCB) design. How do we do that?
**By empowering them to bring their circuit designs to life!**

Read the [GOALS.md](./GOALS.md) for more details.

## TL;DR

OnBoard is a high school program inspiring and supporting 1,000 teenagers to make their first printed circuit board (PCB) within one year. By providing funding, tutorials, and an open-source community, we aim to create a passion for electronics in today's teens.

Every student will receive up to $100 to cover PCB manufacturing costs, and join a community of buzzing, passionate individuals all eager to design circuitry.

## Requirements

Every design/submission needs to meet the following constraints to be approved:

- Unique and open-source design
- Must be orderable on JLCPCB or other [approved vendor](./VENDORS.md)
- Must be in high school[^1] and show proof of high school enrollment to submit

[^1]: Home school still counts!

## The Problem

It's easier than ever for high school students to get involved with programming; all you need is a computing device and internet access. Yet, *it's not the same for hardware*. While PCB fabs have greatly increased the accessibility for professionally done boards, there is still no clear way for high school students to jump in. This is where OnBoard comes in.
