In this folder we're keeping all the notes and planning documents used to organize the event. It'll be a bit messy and you may need context to understand everything going on, but we want to accomplish a couple goals by doing this:

- 1 source of truth: we're already working in this repo, so we might as well keep all our documents in here (instead of hunting for files across google drive, dropbox, github, etc.)
- it's free to see: our hope with keeping everything open is so others can see how we did it and inspire other projects organized in a similar way

Designs that we couldn't add to git can be found in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Yja7uS1E8iDhD2vRP6vNgf/Onboard-design-exploration?type=design&node-id=233%3A35&t=1ZfNpv5bkd37cjqJ-1) and the [poster figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lAk3nZ2gI8uIA97j2gnPSR/OnBoard-posters?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=QnUguM33f8idwvd5-1)
