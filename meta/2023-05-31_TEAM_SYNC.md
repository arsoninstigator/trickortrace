# OnBoard Team Sync 2023-05-31

_In attendance: Al, Daisy, Kevin, Max_

## Updates

- Max
	- Started a [thread for workshops](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C056AMWSFKJ/p1685463814748709), but they need help with structure– there's a **TON** of energy
    - A community team is working on smartwatch from the thread in #onboard-smartwatch
	- Need some sort of community call and workshop
- Kevin
	- Unkinking GitHub actions for PRs
		- Update, this is being transferred to Max, Kevin will create a GH ticket and assign him
- Daisy
	- Processing school enrollment verifications daily– process is working so far
	- Need to touch base with Kevin to figure out when to merge stuff– unclear what PR review process is
	- Some messages need to get out there sooner– Daisy getting spammed with questions like "when the money is coming in"
    - After checking the cause closer in the meeting, this was caused by a failed GH action not posting info when it should have

## TODO:

- Fix GitHub actions (Kevin will create a ticket & Max will fix)
- Get in sync on merging process (Daisy chatting with Kevin)
- Community event on Sunday (Kevin)
  - Marking, events.hackclub.com, & announcement support (Al)
  - Design and banner (Max)
- Edited call needs an intro (Max will reach out to Maggie)

---

## Other:

- Add new vendors to the list
	- Also give a way for people to request new vendors
  - Al recommended OSHPark
- Can we make a thing that posts to #onboard channel on a submission PR?
- Ideas for starting community events and workshops:
  - Hack Clubber runs a “how to create a hackathon badge” <- prioritize this
  - Kevin runs a “these are my projects” call this weekend <- prioritize this
    - announcement post
    - events.hackclub.com
    - drum up interest in the slack
    - like “office hours”, but don’t call it that
    - Sunday is open at 3:30-5:30 pm est (let’s do 4pm)
- Reach out to Shawn Mulluwa to write a workshop on a PCB project (they posted in #onboard offering to write workshop copy) (Al)
- Reach out to Maggie on making a video intro for her workshop (her current video is good but needs a quick intro to give context) (Max)
- Reach out to haxidraw team for making a “drawing thing” PCB
- Dashboard for stats
  - reach out to a hack clubber about building this
  - to display:
    - number of forks
    - average hang time PRs
    - country of submission
    - number of merged PRs
    - number of open PRs
    - average money spent per PRs
