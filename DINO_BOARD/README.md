# DINO BOARD

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

My board is a cute rounded dinosaur modeled after my little cousin's drawing of a dinosaur (his favorite creature) that will have LED lights as its eye as well as along his back to give the look of small spikes.
It will be turned into a clip and gifted to my cousin so he can put it on his backpack.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

The board will cost: $96.83

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

My design process was fairly straightforward.
I am a beginner and it was my first time making a PCB board so I designed the outline on rhino. 
A challenge I encountered was that I changed my mind about a design that turned out pretty good but that would complicate things with all the shapes and cut-outs.
For me, listening to music while working through this project helped a lot, as well as just looking things up on Google when needed.
