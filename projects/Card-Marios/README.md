# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
Following Maggies tutorial I wanted to give a try to make a custom business card with my name.
So that is what I did, with KiCad on my hand I completed the project!

Note: I took a screenshot of the order screen and not the review screen because there wasn't an option to Pay Later.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?
| ITEM            | COST     |
| --------------- | -------- |
| PCB             | 28.61EUR |
| SHIPPING        | 44.61EUR |
| CUSTOMS & TAXES | 17.58EUR |
| TOTAL           | 90.80EUR |

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
The design process was a bit different than the one showed in the video because I used KiCad instead of EasyEDA.
It had its difficulties, especially with the BOM & Part List because they needed to be chanegd a lot.
But Hugo & JLCPCB helped with providing the template.
