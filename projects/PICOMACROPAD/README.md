# PICOMACROPAD
<b> Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? <br> </b>
I'm making a macropad because I couldn't complete #hackpad within it's duration because of schoolwork despite being very fond of the idea of these cute and useful pieces of tech that are pretty easy to make. I already have a Raspberry Pi Pico from #bin so I'm just getting the PCB manufactured through Onboard, soldering components myself and planning on paying for my own custom case and keycaps. The firmware will probably be the hardest bit for me though.

<b> How much is it going to cost? </b>
70$ including shipping
