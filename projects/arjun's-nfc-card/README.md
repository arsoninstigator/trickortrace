# Arjuns NFC Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board functions via NFC. It will be used like a traditionnal business card, when scanned by a phone it will create a note with my contact information.
It has a light that will be on the dot above the "j" above my name that will turn on when the card is scanned.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
for the minimum of 5 PCB's it will cost $2

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Although I was following a very well structured tutorial, I had trouble with the manual routing, I solved my problem by viewing a more detailed video
on routing.
