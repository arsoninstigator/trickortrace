Hi after recieving my order i was informed that I could use the rest of the grant money to  further my pcb knowledge and learning.
I later was introduced to the wonderful world of raspberry pi boards.  I was told by the grant managers that I should ask here and 
try to commit a new order of getting a Rasbperry Pi zero wh here to see if it is within the bounds of the grant. So thats exactly what im going to do.
I would be getting the board and a epaper e-ink display to explore how wifi handshakes work(on my personal networks of course.)
Please view AMZNcart and CartPiShop to see the parts I would like to get.  Thanks!!
