# Shuffl+

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Shuffl+ is a personal audio player inspired by the iPod classic, unlike the iPod classic, Shuffl+ is completely open-source and customizable. I wanted to combine the ideas of a colorful display and a simple-to-use hardware device.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
To make 5 fully assembled PCBs without the Raspberry Pi Zero it is costing me about
USD 65.07

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
