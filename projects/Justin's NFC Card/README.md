# Justin's NFC Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I've made an NFC card that introduces myself to people with links and a fun Winnie the Pooh image on the back!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It seems like it's going to be $34 to build and assemble from jlcpcb.com

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The tutorial from Maggie was awesome!
