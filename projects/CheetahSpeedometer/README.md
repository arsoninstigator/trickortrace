# CheetahSpeedometer

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a speedometer project using a GPS module, Mircocontroller, and display to show how fast you are moving either when running or sitting in a car. 
The GPS module's RX and TX pins connect to Arduino's D2 and D3, respectively.VCC connects to 3.3V, GND to GND, and the backup pin to 3.3V. 
The OLED display connects to the mircocontroller which i will make show speed in Kmph.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost is $101.5. I picked a quantity of 2 economic PCBA's that cost $91.07 along with the prototypes remaining costing 2$ and with the cheapest shipping costing $8.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
During my summer program of a mircoelectronics course, I had not received my kit to actually do the assignment so I just learned how electronics worked which helped me during the design process and found out 
about this oppurtunity of designing a PCB, however this is my first time designing a PCB or how they work. Challenges that I faced were where wires would connect, learning how to desgin a PCB in general, and 
finding the parts nessecary for my idea on EasyEDA.
