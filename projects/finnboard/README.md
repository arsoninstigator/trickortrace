# Finnboard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a keyboard, It has some keys, some optional knobs, some optional buttons, support for MX keyswitches. Hotswappable everything and hopefully a 
3d printable case. The keyboard is designed to be assembled using only "Through the hole" components. I plan to print it on black-lead free pcb because I want to use it prior to designing a 3d printable case for it.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Cost: $37.60
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was fun to get started on a keyboard pcb, and even more fun to be able to print it for free. The tutorials on the hackclub website and the 
entire userbase of reddit and stackoverflow were also crucial with my "stupid" questions.
