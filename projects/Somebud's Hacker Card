# Somebud's Social Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This PCB contains a NFC antenna suitable for lighting up a nifty LED. On it are a few social handles, making it easy to find me across (several) platforms), and on the back you can find the design of my Roblox avatar (as seen when using the handle on the card).

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total it costs $36.15

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
At first I disregarded a lot of the power constraint and went wild with the lights. And thanks to Alex Parker on Slack, they were able to get me back on track. The final design derived from what was supposed to be a simple face (originally of my character), instead into a 3 LED design, down to just a little light up beside my name, finding it a bit nice in the end. The surplus of information you can easily reach online really helped me with this project and the community as a whole with all the guides and the people really got me here, with this product.
