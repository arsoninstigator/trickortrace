# YOUR PROJECT NAME
ESPAudio

I made a board which can show what is currently playing on your Spotify account, and also control the volume of it and control what song is playing. It utlizes an ESP32 to connect to the Spotify API, and will display what is playing on a color LCD, along with being controlled with buttons.

It will cost $3.53 for 5 boards, and $21.33 total with shipping

First, after researching, I created the schematic, then made the PCB layout. After this, once the board arrives and is all soldered, and I confirm that it will work properly, I plan on writing the code for it to run what I want.
