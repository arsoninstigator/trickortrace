# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
A USB key capable of generating TOTPs (2FA codes) and sending them to the attached computer.
Because I want to be able to generate 2FA codes without my phone. Pronounced `/ˌti o ti ˈki/`.

## Plan
Cost for first revision: $51.87, unless I can figure out how to actually apply a JLCPCB coupon
Hopefully everything works on the first revision (thanks to #onboard, especially Hugo and Ishan, for catching some issues before I made v1), but if it doesn't,
I'll fix waht I can by cutting traces and adding jumpers, then order v2.
