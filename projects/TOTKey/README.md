# TOTKey
## Summary
A USB key capable of generating TOTPs (2FA codes) and sending them to the attached computer.
Because I want to be able to generate 2FA codes without my phone. Pronounced `/ˌti o ti ˈki/`.

## Plan
Cost for first revision: $51.87, unless I can figure out how to actually apply a JLCPCB coupon.
Hopefully everything works on the first revision (thanks to #onboard, especially Hugo and Ishan, for catching some issues before I made v1), but if it doesn't,
I'll fix what I can by cutting traces and adding jumpers, then order v2.

## Design
This was designed on EasyEDA. Here's the [project page on OSHWLab](https://oshwlab.com/rivques/totkey) (slow to update sometimes), the [PCB](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=a047122325314c07bb52b96d80c8d825) and the [schematic](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=1f6edd6aa64a423ab0e672aebc9e7131).
