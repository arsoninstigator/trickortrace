# uTesla

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mirrrek/uTesla)

uTesla (_microTesla_) is a small in size, but definitely impressive Tesla coil. It's core drive circuitry is inspired by [Tefatronix](https://tefatronix.g6.cz/)'s (a fellow Czech!) SSTC IV. The driver runs on 24V (up to 28V for those feeling adventurous) and is controlled by an ATmega328P microcontroller with an SD card slot.

Unfortunately, the board was by mistake made twice as large as was originally intended and scaling everything down would require hours of laying out and tracing. As a consequence, **the cost of v1 (including shipping) is 22.55eur**. Later revisions should be less costly.

The driver design is based on [Tefatronix's SSTC IV.](https://tefatronix.g6.cz/display.php?page=sstc4&lang=en)  
The step down buck converter is based on [an article by PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/blog/technology/8_100V_to_5V_1A_DC_to_DC_Buck_Converter_using_MP9486_5a0e0270.html)
