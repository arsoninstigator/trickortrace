# 4 Port USB DOC (CUZ NEW COMPUTERS HATE IO)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
MY computer has very little IO, think 2 usb port!! Now I could go online and order a USB dock.. but what the fun at that! insted I made one of my own to learn more about what it takes to make a dock. It will make sure that I have enough IO for dayssssss
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost 88 dollars after shipping and 70 dollars before shipping

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Well I started off in making a board whose 5v was shorted to GRD... dont ask me how i did it, i just did
Next, I decided that I am not a pro.. so i touched grass and followed a tutorial
Next, I decided that 1 hour of learning later.. i was a pro so insted of makeing a 2 port dock like the guide, I made a 4 dock.. it was hard..
But some coffee and one midnight PCB sesh.. I was done! 
Not quite, I still needed to make the PCB!!!!! that was just the drawing file 
And yes after a lot of gemoerty and unspeakable time later i was done! Finally!!!
