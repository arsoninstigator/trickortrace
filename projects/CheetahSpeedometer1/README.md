# CheetahSpeedometer
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a speedometer project using a GPS module, Microcontroller, and display to show how fast you are moving either when running or sitting in a car. 
The GPS module's RX and TX pins connect to Arduino's D2 and D3, respectively.VCC connects to 3.3V, GND to GND, and the backup pin to 3.3V. 
The OLED display connects to the microcontroller in which I will show speed in Kmph.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The total cost is $101.07. I picked a quantity of 2 economic PCBAs that cost $91.07 and the cheapest shipping of $8. Unfortunately, the price exceeds the grant amount of $100 so I can pay for the shipping or
extra costs.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
During my summer program of a microelectronics course, I had not received my kit to actually do the assignment so I just learned how electronics worked which helped me during the design process, and found out 
about this opportunity of designing a PCB, however, this is my first time designing a PCB or how they work. I faced challenges where wires would connect, learning how to design a PCB in general, and 
finding the parts necessary for my idea on EasyEDA.
