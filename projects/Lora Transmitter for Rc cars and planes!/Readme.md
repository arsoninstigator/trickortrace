# Lora transmitter for rc cars and planes!

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's an esp32 based transmitter, that uses e28 lora modules to give an insane 10km of range!(approx)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Ordering two pcbs, total cost is about $88
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
it was not that hard, especially since i have designed pcbs before, although it was slightly difficult to find docs for the lora modules, and was difficult to find a working esp32, so i could keep the cost down and not pay for standard assembly on jlcpcb!
