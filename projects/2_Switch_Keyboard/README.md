# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
I am trying to make a 2 switch keyboard, that can be used as a macropad, as a switch tester, or just a fidget tool.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?
I plan to order the 5 pcbs from JLCPCB, which quotes them at a total of 2 dollars. 
I then plan to purchase some promicros with headers, and each one costs around 12 dollars.
I'll also need some mill max headers, which will be around 5 dollars. 
So, adding in costs for switches, assembly, and shipping, total cost might be around 80 dollars ish. 

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I was inspired after seeing the 2% milk keyboard, and used it as the basis of my design. I then followed Maggie's tutorial and this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjujZ0f_sk) from Datulab Tech on how to make a pcb!
