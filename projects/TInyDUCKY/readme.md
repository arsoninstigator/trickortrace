# TinyDucky v1.0

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Its a reincarnation of the popular BadUSB board, and can be used to inject keystrokes into the target computer within seconds. It can be wasily concealed, being the perfect mischievous tool! 
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Its gonna cost $36, ($2 + $34), and I will be ordering the basic 5 boards

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I used EasyEDA to design it, and a little bit of documentation and reddit really helped in making the board perfect!
