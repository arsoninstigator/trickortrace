# MUSICA (Magical Ukulele, Supplier of Immaculate Chords and Audio)

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A PCB for an Electric Ukulele that is being made for Hack Club's The Trail 2024 event! Using an Atmega328P in hopes of collecting audio through a pickup that is custom made, it includes a built in amp and speakers so you can play whenever you dont have any power!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Using a double-sided PCB to save space on the ukulele, it will cost $201.73. I am working with @Awagran and wanted to combine our grants into one.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
