# LianaNCFCard

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

Hello! I made an NCF hackcer card that once tapped to someone's phone, will bring up a link of a YouTube video.
The video mentioned is one that shows my robotics team dancing to Sweet Caroline. :)

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
According to JLPCB, it will cost $53.09.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Wiring the ciruit and the vias were really really hard. I have ordered this card before and it failed because i forgot to check
off the assembly section. Though I had a lot of trouble, I want to try this again because it will be worth it if it works.
