# 7.5V to 5V converter
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9ab09c-a868-4083-a859-70c0792df13e)

This is my 7.5V to 5V converter made with KiCad. I know it's easy but it's my first PCB project.
Also it misses cart.png files, i know... But there is a problem with JLCPCB, sorry.
To prove I tried I will place the required BOM and CPL files and a screenshot of JLCPCB.

No problem if I don't receive the pcb, I'm doing it for experience and making a PR was a motivation for me.  
Thanks HC!
