### Description
I followed maggie's tutorial and customized my own board.

### Cost
It will cost $95.49 with a $10 coupon from JLCPCB.

### Experience
The hardest part was settling on a design I liked and then trying to figure out the difference between ENIG layer heights (still haven't figured them out). Maggie did a great job with the tutorial and as a beginner I found it very easy to follow.
