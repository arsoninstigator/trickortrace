# Personal NFC Card and PCB Ruler

### Description
I followed maggie's tutorial and customized my own board. I also followed Ian Dunn's PCB ruler guide.

### Cost
It will cost $86.34 with a $10 coupon from JLCPCB.

### Experience
The hardest part was settling on a design I liked and then trying to figure out the difference between ENIG layer heights (still haven't figured them out) and surface finish options. Maggie did a great job with the tutorial and as a beginner I found it very easy to follow.
