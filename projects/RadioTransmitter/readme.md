# RF Transmitter Using Raspberry Pi Pico
## Overview
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico as the central control unit for a robust RF transmitter and receiver system.

The transmitter incorporates the NRF24L01 transceiver module for reliable data transmission, 
while an OLED display provides real-time feedback on channel percentage values being sent. 
The Pi Pico manages all operations, orchestrating the NRF24L01 for data exchange.

This RF transmitter system offers a cost-effective solution for remote data transmission and control applications.

## Transmitter Components:
##### Raspberry Pi Pico: Acts as the core controller.
##### NRF24L01 Transceiver Module: Facilitates the transmission of data wirelessly.
##### OLED Display: Displays the percentage values of each channel currently transmitting.

## cost:
The cost of Transmitter is 2094.00 INR ;that is 25.10 USD this also include the assembly cost
