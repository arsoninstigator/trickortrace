# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### My objective is to develop an Automatic Home Appliances Controller that enables the control of lights, fans, and home appliances via a mobile app using Bluetooth connectivity. This controller will have the capacity to manage up to four appliances simultaneously, providing instant updates within the application.

## Plan
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Maufacturing  | $68.93 |
| Shipping      | $27.54 |
| Total         | $96.47 |

It will take 4-5 days to setup the project once I receive the PCB.

## Design
#### Having never designed a PCB before, I found it to be the most challenging aspect of the project. However, I thoroughly enjoyed learning the process from YouTube. Once I had a solid understanding of the basics, I used EasyEDA to design and create this PCB.
