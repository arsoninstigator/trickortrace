# NFC BUSINESS CARD
## Summary
##### My board is a business card. It has links to my website, github, and lego ideas. When a phone is held near it, it will take the person to my website.

## Plan
##### I think this design is under $5. $2 I'm pretty sure.

## Design
##### I followed Maggie's tutorial which was very helpful. I then added some of my own designs using the knowledge I had gained from her tutorial. I had some issues with .svg files but they were easily resolved. Overall the biggest issue I had was with EasyEDA crashing!
