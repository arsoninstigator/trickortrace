Summary
I created another NFC Business Card from Maggie Liu's tutorial. I will link it to my friends channel as I have made this card for their birthday.
Order 5 boards (or are they cards now) from JCLPCB, with parts comes out to just over $67 with a "special offer. Shipping is $17.80.

Then probably make another batch with a different design? Not sure on the rules for this.

Design
I mainly followed the tutorial while playing around with the design.
