# DoS Chicago Solstice Hackathon

<!-- Boards for the 2024 Chicago Day of Service Hackathon with a Summer Solstice and Egyptian theme. Board lights up when tapped and also has qr code back to our website. -->

<!-- It is $96.90 for most of the boards needed for the event and we hope to get them by June 19th ( Hackathon starts on the 20th )-->

<!-- I'm still very much a beginner in PCB making so it was a bit of learning curve. Luckily I had a really great tutorial to guide me! -->
