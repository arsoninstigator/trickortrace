# BlackCardNFCPcb

I made Maggie Liu's design for a buisness card nfc pcb.  I quit making PCB's some time ago but before i would make them for drones so I really want to get back into making PCB's and I think this nice project will help me get back into it.

The cost is $21.11

I dont really have a timeline but I would like it to be shipped to me in under 7 buisness days.

Thanks!!!!
