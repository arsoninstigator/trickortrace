# Rohan's NFC Business Card
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
It's an NFC business card I plan to give to new connections. It will use NFC touch capabilities to transmit my website to a phone, while simultaneously harvesting energy from the phone to light up an LED.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?
PCB is $32.34, shipping is $26.41. Total is $58.75.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
I created the design for my board in Inkscape, so I revisited my vector art design skills for this project. It was fun!
