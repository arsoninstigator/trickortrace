# Desktop Numberpad

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My PCB project combines multiple small components together into a functional numberpad for any modern computer. It has USB-C functionality and supports a very wide variety of mechanical keyswitches. A 3D-Printed enclosure is in the works, but I want to have a working circuit before I finalize that.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It should cost around $25 per keypad when it is done, but for the basic PCBs and assembly the cost from JLCPCB is $90.22 plus shipping due to poor planning of special parts on my end.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I struggled with making sure all the components were in the optimal place for routing originally, but I figured it out after a few hours.
