# DIY DRONE
## Summary
##### Its the fc, esc and the lights modules for a diy drone that I am making. the parts are coming from lcsc, the sister company of JLCPCB, and the pcbs from JLCPCB 

## Plan
##### The entire thing is cgoing to cost about $124 + shipping of about $70-80. since its 2 of us, me and my friend, it should be ok, and should cover the costs!
