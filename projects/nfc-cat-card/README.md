nfc-cat-card

My first pcb design using easyeda! I designed a playing card of the nonexistent club of jacks (j, my initial). It uses an nfc chip that harvests energy from a device and I will program a link to be 
sent to the device (my creative portfolio!)

Total cost: $20.63

The design process lowkey stressed me out, there were 16 DRC errors that I had in the end, and I didn't know if they were relevant.
