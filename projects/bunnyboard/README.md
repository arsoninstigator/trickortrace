<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a PCB for a stenography keyboard (28 keys, using Lapwing theory)! It's powered by a Raspberry pi pico W so it can connect via USBC and Bluetooth ^.^.


<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$53.43 (Assembling 2x back sides of PCB. JLPCB does not sell kailh choc v1 switches, so I'll buy them and solder it on myself)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
This is the first PCB I've made in Kicad and trying to understand how to use the footprint editor was a pain! This is also the first keyboard I've made.
