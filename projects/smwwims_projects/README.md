# 1. HIVE Interface Board
## Summary
Iâ€™m currently trying to build a Hexapod Platform (also known as Stewart Platform). I have a Raspberry Pi as a controller and six linear actuators to drive the platform. In order to connect the linear actuators with the motor drivers and the motor drivers with the raspberry in a clean and organized way, I have designed an interface board.

## Plan
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| PCBs          | $8.70  |
| Shipping      | $17.70 |
| Customs       | $5.28  |
| Discount      |-$10.10 |
| Total         | $21.58 |

## Design
What helped me when designing my interface board was just analyzing other interface boards, like the Arduino Shields.


# 2. NFC Business Card
## Summary
As many other Hack Clubbers I also designed a nfc business card I can give to recruiters. It's basically the same schematic just with another design on top of it.

## Plan
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| PCBs          | $48.60 |
| Shipping      | $18.75 |
| Customs       | $13.47 |
| Discount      |-$10.10 |
| Total         | $70.72 |
| Grand Total   | $92.30 |

## Design
The [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/PCB-Business-Card-With-NFC/) by Loann Boudin was really fascinating. I liked that he also explained the technical backgrounds of the components and not just made a basic list of instructions without any explanations.
