# 1. HIVE Interface Board
## Summary
Iâ€™m currently trying to build a Hexapod Platform (also known as Stewart Platform). I have a Raspberry Pi as a controller and six linear actuators to drive the platform. In order to connect the linear actuators with the motor drivers and the motor drivers with the raspberry in a clean and organized way, I have designed an interface board.

## Plan
I have already designed the board and have all parts at home to solder it. The only thing left is the pcb which costs:
| Type of Cost  | Cost   |
| ------------- | ------ |
| PCB           | $8.70  |
| Shipping      | $19.27 |
| Customs       | $3.60  |
| Discount      | -$9.99 |
| Total         | $21.58 |

## Design
What helped me when designing my interface board was just analyzing other interface boards, like the Arduino Shields.


# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
