# Self-Playing Chess Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I will use this board to help me complete a self-playing chess baord (a project that I have been working on for a couple of months now). The board will allow me to control the two stepper motors I will be using, the servo motor, and two limit swithces.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The board itself is going to cost 2 dollars, but shipping might add to it.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
in terms of designing the pcb, the entirety of the design process was challenging. This is the first time that I was designing a PCB, so I had to learn everything from the ground up
