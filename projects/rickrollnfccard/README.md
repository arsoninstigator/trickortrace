<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's a basic NFC card. But I will write a rickroll link to it. So that I can rickroll everyone lol

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
"Order Total: $36.41"

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Using EasyEDA was simple but the routing proccess was a pain in the butt
