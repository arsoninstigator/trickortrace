USB Hub

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
My board is a USB hub. I intend for it to be incorperated into my cyberdeck, so I can attach more devices to it. 

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
In total it should cost $9.54
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Since this is my first board there were a few learning curves on how to use the software and getting everything to work right. I especially struggled with tracing all the wiring. 
But overall it was tons of fun and I hope to make another pcb soon.
