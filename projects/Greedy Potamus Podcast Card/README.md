# Greedy Potamus Promotion Card

I am making a buisness card from my podcast about finance the Greedy Potamus Podcast. On my card I have a RF chip, LED, and a qr code for people to scan.

This is goign to cost 8$ for 10 or $.80 each.

Soem challenges were figuring out places with short curcuits and fixing them.
