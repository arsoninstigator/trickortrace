# Cool NFC Card project

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
A simple nfc card that works as a business card too, and transmits contact details via NFC. I bet this is gonna be cool, its my first PCB.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost about $40 including shipping (Except customs)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I had to give about 4 hours since i shorted all the wires somehow. But eventually I made it and finished this project in just 5 hours!
