# Keyboard PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a Keyboard PCB that helps mechanical keyboard builders everywhere! Instead of handwiring each
key meticulously, all you have to do is solder onto the pcb and solder a controller and you're done!

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
~$30 for this iteration

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
