# Ishit's PCB

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This PCB is basically my business card with my github profile, itch io profile, spotfiy code and my personal website.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
around 40-45 dollars without shipping.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The tutorial definitely helped a lot, and gave me a lot of ideas, but I was still struggling to get ideas for my PCB but I am satisfied with the result.
