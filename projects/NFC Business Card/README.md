## Summary
##### A PCB based Business Card with NFC support.

## Plan
##### Followed the instructon video provided by maggie (thanks for it), but I have designed it on my own with some inspiration drawn from instructables.its around $30 in total(with coupon), I have selected the cheapest shipping method (for 12-20 days) so that it could save money!

## Design
##### The pcb board (88.93mm by 50.8mm) has two layers, the top layer is supposed to be assembled and have the electrical components with a design. On the bottom layer lies the contact information and profile with some cool designs.The biggest challenge was routing all connections, but it was fun.
