# EthanSongMauroProject

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? 

My board will be a led chaser based on a 555 timer clock. It has the design of our amazing teacher imprinted on the circuit as well for extra flair. It will serve as an excellent tool for our class in the future. -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? 

27.60$ -->

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** 

We had a tutorial from Miss Angelina Tsuboi and Mr John Cohn so it was not too bad. But Easy EDA is a bit annoying and also they don't even let us check if this thing actually works. Hopefully it will. -->
