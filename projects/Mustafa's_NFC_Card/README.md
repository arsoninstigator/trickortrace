# Mustafa's NFC Card

## Project Overview

### What are you making? What will it do?
I have developed an NFC-activated "Business Card" for personal use. When a phone taps the card, it will open my LinkedIn profile and illuminate an LED.

### Estimated Cost
Approximately $39 USD

### Design Process and Challenges
I followed Maggie's tutorial on creating an NFC business card, which was extremely helpful. I also incorporated additional designs into my card. The process had its challenges, but the tutorial provided clear guidance and support.
