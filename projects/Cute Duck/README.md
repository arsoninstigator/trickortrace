# Cute Duck

I am designing a PCB for a duck-shaped LED board. This board will feature a series of LEDs that light up to outline the shape of a duck. The LEDs will be powered by a small battery, providing a decorative and illuminated display.

It cost of this is $50.96 (USD)

During the design process of my duck-shaped LED board, I faced challenges with arranging the LEDs in a way that accurately followed the duck's outline while maintaining electrical connections.
