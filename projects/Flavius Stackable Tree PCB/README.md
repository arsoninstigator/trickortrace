Stackable PCB Tree keychain

Im making a PCB that can be stacked making a small tree keychain. It has leds that will blink and the blinking could be programmed accordingly. My design has 6 pinout that could light 12 leds and uses a rod to "stack" the pcb.

$3.46/5pcs - First time buyer discount.

The design process went alright, but its kinda challenging. In fact I had to redesign the pcb once, tracing the tracks is one of the hardest things I encountered. My past experience on designing 1 layer pcb definitely helps since I was only able to produce very simple 1 layer pcb and there was some tricks I could reintegrate on the 2 layer pcb. The pcb is messy and so is the schematics, I would consider them very unreliable for mass producing and profesional grade producing but it is a learning step for me and I am absolutely excited to have the pcb on my hand.
