# PROJECT NAME
## Summary
The WiFi Card is a simple NFC card that is designed to be programmed to give anyone who visits your house instant access to the wifi.

## Plan
This simple design only costs $6.56. By picking the cheapest shipping option, the entire design can be produced for $8.06. Probably going to produce several other business card designs and maybe experiment with 2 NFC antennas in 1 card.

## Design
Maggie's workshop was super helpful!

The front of this design features a WiFi icon & an NFC tag while the back features the username & password for devices that do not have NFC readers built into them.
