Hacker Business Card
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

The card will display my info, what I do, and a cool LED that lights up the mask's eye when connected to a  9-volt battery. The attached resistor assures no overcurrent.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->

Around 52 dollars, I will order 5 of them along with PCBA.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? Totally optional -->

I learned how to design a basic PCB in EasyEda and how to add text and components.
