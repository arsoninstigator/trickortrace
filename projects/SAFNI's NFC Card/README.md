## Summary
##### A PCB based Business Card with NFC support.

## Plan
##### I followed the instructional video provided by Maggie (thanks for it), but I designed it on my own, drawing inspiration from Instructables. It cost around $30 in total (with a coupon). I selected the cheapest shipping method (12-20 days) to save money!

## Design
##### The PCB board (88.93mm by 50.8mm) has two layers. The top layer is intended for assembly and contains the electrical components along with a design. On the bottom layer, there's the contact information and profile along with some cool designs. The biggest challenge was routing all connections, but it was fun.
