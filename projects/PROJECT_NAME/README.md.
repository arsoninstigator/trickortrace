#My first try at this
## This is a PCB Hacker Card
##### This board contains a nfc chip in it. It will be able to put up my website on a phone and at the same time an led will light up. The front of the board has my email and a QR code to my website.

## My Plan is to order this thing and get the nfc tag in it to work. Then upload my website to it.
##### It will cost a total of $61.15 US Dollars. My timeline is that when I get these to make the nfc chip to work and bring people to my website and who I am.

## My design is a board with an led and an nfc chip in it that would bring people to a website. On the top of the card there would be text including my email and a QR code to the website if the device does not have NFC
##### I followed some derections from hackclub.com on how to make it, although it was still a bit chalenging and took me over an hour and a half. I struggled very hard on the concept on differnt layers (this was my first time making a board)
