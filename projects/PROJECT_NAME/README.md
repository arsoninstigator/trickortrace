# ESP32 Clock


This board uses an ESP32 Dev module with an SSD1306 display and DS1307 RTC to display the current time, weather data, as well as serving as an alarm clock with a buzzer. This will have a 3D printed casing and be mounted to my wall so I will never oversleep again!

$32.67

There was a lot of difficulty with getting the ESP32 integrated wifi to work when prototyping
