## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
So, Starting with a basic design. I added my name, hobbies, a qr code, an nfc tag logo, and some social icons.
I decided not to add links/profile names with the social icons I added bacause I might change the username in the future.

For the back side of the card, I wanted to make it look more it ME so I decided to try some doodling. I ran into a whole BUNCH of problems but then finally figured it all out somehow, and her is how it looks right now:-
