# LinusCard
## Summary
This is my version from the NFC Business Card tutorial.

## Plan
This is pretty cheap. Because this was the first thing that I designed, after I see how these turn out I'll go design another thing using the remaining funds.

## Design
Started off with the tutorial but I ended up completing it by figuring things out by myself with a lot of trial and error and clicking random buttons. Maybe next time I'll save some time by finishing the tutorial.
