# Anthony Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I followed the hacker card tutorial to make my own business card. It has my name, GitHub handle, website domain, and two drawings of me. The NFC tag should open my website.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Ordering 5 cards will cost $18.62, and the cheapest shipping option was for $8.00, bringing the total to $26.62.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I originally intended to use this as a learning project so I can use the grant to make a USB dock. After looking at the USB hub tutorial and then watching videos to see how USB docks work, I realized it was way beyond my scope, so I just stuck to the card.
