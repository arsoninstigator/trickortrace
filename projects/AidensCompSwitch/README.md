# AidensCompSwitch

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
- I am making a competetion controller switch for VEX Robotics Competetion (VRC). It Interfaces with the controller, and deter,mines what mode the robot is is (Disabled, Enabled Driver, Enabled Auton). 
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
I am getting 50 boards, as this is to help my school's robotics program which is fairly large. The cost for the 50 Boards is $20.20 and assembly is $62.51, making the total cost be $82.71. 

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->

I had to determine how the controller interacts with the normal rj45 competetion switch. This was difficult, but I eventually figured it out.
