# PCB Hacker Card

## Summary

This is a PCB Hacker Card that has an NFC chip that I will link to my github.

## Plan

I plan to order the 20 pcbs from JLCPCB, which quotes them at a total of about 96 dollars after shipping. It will probably take 3-4 days according to the website.

## Design

I was following the tutorial and although I tried to make my own design, it didn't work because it wasn't a rectangle.
