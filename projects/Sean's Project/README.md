# Modular RP2040
## Summary
I am making a collection of boards that will connect together in order to make a functional RP2040.
The key components are:
- Backplane
- USB Connector board
- Power board
- RP2040
- 1V1 Decoupling board
- 3V3 Decoupling board
- Flash
- Clock
- Control board (has power button, LED connected to the GPIO25 pin, Reset button, Bootsel button)
## Plan
Most of the plan discussed above.
### Cost
Â£170.85 ($217.22)
## Design
I learn't how to build footprints and symbols while building this. The biggest issue was revisiting how to use the rp2040
