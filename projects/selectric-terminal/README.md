# Selectric to terminal conversion

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
Turning an IBM Selectric typewriter into a serial terminal. Using solenoids to control the typewriter and microswitches to read the keyboard.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Around 70 dollars for parts, excluding the PCB. I was able to save some money on the solenoids by buying from Aliexpress.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was my first time playing around with the EasyEDA autorouter, and it was finnicky to get working properly. In the end I got it to somewhat cooperate with enough fiddling around.
