# ArnavNavigation

## Summary

This is a board that will allow moving things to navigate using a GPS and IMU(inertial messurement unit). It has pins on it to manipulate servos. Additionally, any aspect of the pico can be used after navigation calculations are performed.  

## Plan

It will cost about 50USD and once all materials are recived, the PCB should be completed in one weekend. 

## Design

I had never designed a PCB, so this was a great learning experience overall!
