# SANGS TOTK KEY

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a TOTK board inspired by "rivques" that i saw featured on the onboard website
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
The price of the Whole Board is $95.84
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
I saw rivques and I loved the use case, I replicated his schematic from scratch but there were some "random" or unfamilier
parts when I searched up the numbers. Everything was smooth when I was routing the 
cables for the PCB I may had made some mistakes but the DRC indicator shown I did it right!
