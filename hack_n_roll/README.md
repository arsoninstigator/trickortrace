# Hack'n Roll!

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a little keychain to give out to friends who want to see my magnificent skills at rocking on! It uses a small button battery (like from a watch) to power an LED that shines through. I removed the solder mask of the board to let the LED's light show up on the front when the LED is enabled.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It'll be about $25 because I couldn't find all the parts in the basic catalogue and needed to grab some parts from the extended library.
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
It was kinda straight forward but hard to use the editor because I am a dinosaur and only have 3 big nails on each stumpy leg, so you can imagine just how difficult it is to type this message.
