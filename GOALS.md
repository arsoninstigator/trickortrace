# Goals

## Goal Measurement

The success of the OnBoard program's goal to inspire and support 1,000 teenagers in making their first PCB will be measured by categorizing submissions into two groups: *beginner* and *experienced* projects.

The program aims to have 300 experienced projects and 700 beginner projects by the end of the year.

### Beginning projects

Beginner projects will usually be the submitter's first foray into PCB design, using few components and based on existing projects or tutorials.
### Experienced projects
Experienced projects will usually be from someone who has made PCBs before, be very original, and have with multiple components.
