#NFC Business Card
It's a business card that uses the nfc tag to transfer all the information to other's person phone just by taping on it.

What are you making? What will it do?
I saw the onboard workshow by maggie through I made this nfc tag , a special thing about this tag is that it has an dynamic qr code on it. that means I could change the qr code content anythime I want.

How much is it going to cost?
$57.26
