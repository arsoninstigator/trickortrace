Design a unique PCB from scratch and submit it to the project gallery via a pull request in the <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard" style="color: #ff8c37; text-decoration: underline;">GitHub repository</a> on the opening date for an additional grant on top of OnBoard's <a href="https://hackclub.com/onboard/" style="color: #ff8c37; text-decoration: underline;">$100 base grant</a>.

Approved submissions will receive a limited-edition accessory kit, and top entries will be awarded a grant for PCB fabrication, components (including LCSC & DigiKey), or tools — just in time to show it off for Halloween!
